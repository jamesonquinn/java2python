This directory holds python scripts to transform java AST 
to complete a `parse-java | transform.py | pp-java2py` toolchain.

`j2py.py` collects all working transformations.

The scripts rely on the `aterm` library, which can be tested with `test/test.py`

Directory `test/java` includes java sources of running programms.
Most of them where copied from the yava2python project
(TODO: add pointer).
